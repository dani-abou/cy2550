Firstly I did some Google research on which password manager was said to be the best. Many came up, 1password, Dashlane, and Keeper were the most common (other than Lastpass that I chose).
Originally, I picked Dashlan, since Professor Shelat had discussed it in class, and I thought it looked nice. But when I found out that the service was intended to be payed for, and the free version was very limited, I was turn off of it.
Furthermore, I wanted a service that could connect and work well through my phone. Lastpass came up as fitting my two criteria well.
Not only is it mostly free features, but I've already installed it on my phone and saved all my passwords in there.
My master password will take me some time to remember, since I generated it from diceware with 5 dice rolls.
